  caveats <<~EOS
    Setups is ad-hoc signed (Apple notarization is in progress), so the FIRST
    launch needs a one-time approval — run:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Setups.app"

    or open the app once (it will be blocked), then
    System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> "Open Anyway".

    The powerful optional CLI lives inside the app:
      Settings -> Install CLI  (tab completion included)
  EOS
